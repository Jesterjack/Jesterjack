## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've joined GitHUB as one of the steps to get back into game development for myself.

I've spent the last 8 years or so working on more creative aspects such as song-writing, world-building, learning instruments, drawing, etc. I've decided it's time to get back into the programming side of development.
I've also developed skills as a sound engineer along the way, though I'm mainly working in live settings.
I currently work full-time as a Production Manager for a country artist in Texas and tour most of the year around the country.
I figured GameMaker would be a great way to fill down time on the road and flesh out ideas I kicked around since graduating.

I'm mainly focused right now on refreshing my knowledge on GameMaker, as well as trying to learn new concepts and design tools.
If anyone has resources or repositories that would help me grow my knowledge in the application, I would love to talk and hopefully collaborate in the future.
The next step is to pick up where I left off last and develop a small Beat'Em Up project I started in college.
From there, I hope to regularly start working on new game concepts that I've been building for the last few years.

You can reach me at my email mryanroberts@gmail.com if you have any interest in sharing ideas or working together down the road.

Hope to see you around! Peace!
Ryan
